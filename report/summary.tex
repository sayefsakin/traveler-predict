\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:summary}
Learning based interactive database exploration is an ongoing research problem in scientific community. I started working on this project to make the data
exploration of Traveler more interactive and convenient for the user based on an active learning based prediction technique. After doing some literature
study, I've came to know about state-of-the art works like \emph{ForeCahce}\cite{battle2016dynamic}, \emph{Kyrix}\cite{tao2019kyrix},
\emph{Skyrec}\cite{liu2019improvement}, \emph{AIDEme}\cite{huang2019aideme}, etc. I designed a parser to fetch live formatted OTF2 performance data from
the Traveler. To make the data labeling easier, a separate script is written to label the dataset and present to the recommender model. The parsed data is
formated accordingly to the feature abstraction described in Section\ref{sec:technical}. Then by following the DSM algorithm, the basic classifier engine has
been developed with slight tweaking according to the domain needs. A conveninent interface has been provided to make prediction feedback available towards
the Traveler system. Lastly, A priliminary performance evaluation has been conducted to assess the engine on how well it predicted based on the labelling
provided by the user. A comprehensive report has been created and necessary descriptions provided in this report with the insights learned through this
project.
