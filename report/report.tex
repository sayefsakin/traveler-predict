%% Abstract section - 5 pts
\abstract{
Understanding large scale runtime system behavior becomes harder as the hardware performance metric data grows significantly over time. Identifying
relationship within different performance metric could be accessory to assessing and evaluating these data. The Traveler project provides an integrated
visualization system for visualizing performance metric data. It uses OTF2 execution traces and present them over several interactive views like - Gantt
view, Utilization view, Time series view etc. Highlighting key features from these views is crucial to artifact detection and optimization of a runtime system.
Therefore, providing prediction of different features in advance will be helpful for user to browse, lookup, and identify them. Also the prediction could be
useful for any backend caching mechanism to load data in advance, hence improving user interactivity. In this project, an automated learning based feature
prediction model has been proposed for analysing temporal performance metric data labeled by the user and providing prediction of
interesting features for any future performance data. A dedicated python class has been developed for the Traveler platform to provide the feature prediction,
which could be utilized by any backend data model or directly integrated as a module with the frontend controller.
